<h1>Pre-Arrival Information</h1>

<h2>Accessing your Onyen Login</h2>
<p>Once you get your PID (personal identification number) from the university, you can make your onyen account at <a href="https://onyen.unc.edu/cgi-bin/unc_id/services" target="_blank">Onyen Services</a></p>

<h2>Test Onyen and WebMail</h2>
<p>Goto http://live.unc.edu/ and try logging in with your id/password. Your department might have an alternative webmail such as GMail (CS Department) rather than the default Outlook Email offered by UNC. Check with your department IT folks for more details on this.</p>

<p>The onyen is your official unc ID, through which you can access the student center at <a href="http://www.unc.edu/myunc/" target="_blank">ConnectCarolina Student Center</a>. You can see your details, and register for courses here. The only other thing that you will require is the PIN for that semester. The PIN is a 4-digit no. allotted to you by you dept. for that semester. If you haven't received this PIN you can obtain it by mailing the Graduate Secretary for your dept. The Graduate Secretary's email id can be found in the Staff directory of your department's website. If you are unable to register before coming to UNC, do not worry about it as the first semester courses are the core courses and the department can register you for them after you arrive here.</p>

<h2>Health related issues</h2>
<p>You must have received a medical-record form sent by the university. It is really important that you complete this form carefully otherwise you might end up taking doses here which would incur additional costs. Undergo a complete medical check-up, including eye and dental examinations. Ensure that you have taken all necessary immunizations as stipulated in the immunization record that the university mails out to you. 

<p>It is advisable to get MMR and Hepatitis B immunization shots in India as they are very costly here. Remember to bring the medical certification or endorsed proof of your completed immunization. This document is important since without it you might not be able to sign up for courses. If you make any cancellations/mistakes/white-ink on the medical-record form sent by UNC make sure you get the doctors signature next to it again. </p>

<p>Health insurance is mandatory at UNC. You cannot enroll for classes unless you are covered by a health insurance policy. But do bring medication like Crocin, Asprin, Vicks, Iodex, cough syrup, anti-vomiting, multivitamins, antacids, eyedrops, eardrops, medicines for stomach aches, headaches, antibiotics for skin diseases and cough etc, as they can be very expensive here (and your insurance policy will not cover for medicines costing less than 20$ due to co-pay ...so you end up paying for them in case you need them after coming here). Also, be sure to get the prescription for all the medicines that you get along with you otherwise you might have problems with customs. 1-2 spare eyeglasses/contact lenses (about 20-50 per pair) if you have glasses.</p>

<h2>Register Courses</h2>
<p>Once you are able to access your Onyen Account, you can login to <a href="http://www.unc.edu/myunc/" target="_blank">ConnectCarolina Student Center</a> and enroll for courses. Check with your department teaching schedule for the list of courses offered in current fall/spring semester .</p>

<h2>Tickets</h2>
<p>Block the ticket first. You need not pay anything while blocking, it’s free! You can pay later after your visa interview and after your ticket and schedule is confirmed. Block flights with many airlines.</p>
<ul class="notelist">
    <li>Try and book a one stop flight to RDU Airport. There are no direct flights to RDU Airport from India. Avoid change of airline.</li>
    <li>If change of airline can't be avoided, leave at least 4-6 hrs of gap between the scheduled arrival of one flight and the scheduled departure of the connecting flight.</li>
    <li>Baggage is usually safe with a single airline – change of airline sometimes leads to misplaced luggage. Some airlines don't take care of baggage transfer – you may have to personally carry it (check this while booking) and cross check every thing you are promised by the Travel Agent with the original airlines, even if you have a confirmed ticket in your hand.</li>
    <li>Also, if you are changing airlines in the US, and your international airline allows extra baggage, confirm with the domestic airline too if it allows the same. In most cases, the rules for baggage are different for domestic travelers.</li>
    <li>Remember to ask for student concessions. Generally all the airlines will come up with discount offer for students. So check all this out before you pay the money.</li>
    <li>Typical expenses: Rs. 40,000 – Rs. 60,000</li>
</ul>
