<h1>Books</h1>
<h2>General Tip</h2>
<p>It's not possible to bring all the books listed below, hence, ask your parents to ship them from India via Speed Post or Courier. Choose the least expensive option since you don't need all of it in a hurry.</p>

<h2>Mathematics</h2>
<p>No matter what your field of research is, Mathematics will be an integrated part of it. So, it's highly advisable to get your 11th and 12th grade books along with the Engineering Mathematics Textbooks to revise and boost your Math level. If you took a break in studies and went to work in Industry, your Math level would have decayed sufficiently and hence requires a lot of work.</p>

<h2>Computer Science</h2>
<p>These books will also help your interview preparation along with your academics</a>
