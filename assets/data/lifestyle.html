<h1>Lifestyle</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The first rule of living away from family and managing your finances is, don't rely on friends to lend you high amounts of money and don't lend high amounts of money to friends. Once you get here, open an account with Bank of America (or any other bank of your choice as long as it is a reputed bank and they have ATM machines available close to you). Once you get your SSN, get a couple of credit accounts from reputed banks so you can start building your credit history.</p>

<h2>Tracking Expenses</h2>
<p>If you are living with roommates and if you tend to do groceries, rent etc. together, set up a <a href="http://splitwise.com/" target="_blank">Splitwise</a> / <a href="http://www.billmonk.com/" target="_blank">Billmonk</a> account (or any other) to manage expenses and keep track of who owes whom. Try to not carry over debts from friends for more than 2 months (unless absolutely necessary). A good way to build credit history is to use credit cards regularly, pay your credit card bills every month, get your name on the housing lease, and have at least one utility in your name, phone, Internet, cable, water or electricity.</p>

<h2>Online Coupons / Deals</h2>
<p>If you are planning to buy expensive (or electronic) items, look up online for deals and coupons. I cannot stress this point enough because you can save a lot of money with a good bit of googling around.</p>

<h2>Caveat</h2>
<p>It would be a good idea to chalk out a budget based on your income so that you can manage your finances most efficiently. An app like <a href="https://www.mint.com" target="_blank">Mint</a> might help you out. Most students buy a car in a year or two of being here. If you plan on buying one, start saving for it. If you have an on-campus job, it might be a good idea to open an account with the State Employees' Credit Union, which gives a better rate of interest than other banks. As always, the older students are here to help!</p>
