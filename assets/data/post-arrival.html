<h1>Post-Arrival Information</h1>

<h2>Check-In with OISSS:</h2>

<p>Soon after arrival in Chapel hill, check-in in person with the <a href="http://oisss.unc.edu/" target="_blank">OISSS</a> (Office of International Student & Scholar Services) to receive your Welcome Packet which includes a campus map, social security application, and course listing booklet. Take your passport, I-20 or IAP-66, and I-94 card. Check-in takes about 20 minutes and volunteers are available Monday-Friday, 8:00am-4:00pm (8:00-16:00). ALL STUDENTS MUST CHECK-IN WITH OISSS, REGARDLESS OF VISA STATUS. See <a href="http://oisss.unc.edu/students/index.html" target="_blank">http://oisss.unc.edu/students/index.html</a> for more details.</p>

<h2>Check-In with your department: </h2>

<p>Check-in at your department office and meet the Graduate Advisor or Secretary. They will hand you your course schedule and make photocopies of your documents like the I-20 & passport, etc. It is also a good idea to take prior appointments with Professors via e-mail to discuss possible research opportunities.</p>

<h2>Open a student checking and savings account:</h2>

<p>You can visit Wells Fargo or Bank of America on Franklin Street and open a checking and/or savings account. You can also open an account with SECU (State Employees Credit Union but for that you need SSN first). Do remember to tell them name of the senior who recommended you to open account (that gets us and you some money). Deposit the bank drafts/travelers cheques you are carrying into the accounts. You can deposit the fees draft in the bank and then hand a cheque to the cashier office, or you can directly give your draft to the cashier office.</p>

<p>It is a good idea to open both Checking and Savings Account. Let the big transactions (incoming/outgoing) happen via Savings account and use the Checking account for daily usage (Debit Card). Once you get any assistantship (RA or TA), take your employment letter & SSN and go to BofA or Wells Fargo and apply for a Credit Card and this will help you build credit history.</p>

<h2>Go to the Cashier’s Office to Pay Fees:</h2>

<p>Visit the Cashier’s office in order to pay the fees if you haven’t already paid it via wire transfer or electronic transfer. The address of the UNC Cashier’s office is stated at UNC Cashier  (see Contact /  Contact Us). In case of sponsorship, show your proof of sponsorship to them.</p>

<h2>Get your Student ID card:</h2>

<p>Go to the <a href="http://www.onecard.unc.edu/" target="_blank">UNC OneCard</a> office and get your student-ID made. This helps you get access to almost all the student services available. See the Contact Us section at <a href="http://www.onecard.unc.edu/" target="_blank">UNC OneCard</a> for the address.</p>

<h2>Visit Campus/Student health services:</h2>

<p>The student health services office is at the James A Taylor building (<a href="http://campushealth.unc.edu/general-info/contact-us" target="_blank">CHS Address</a>). You need to carry the medical-record form and all the relevant proofs of immunization. Also, book an appointment via phone or at the CHS office for the <a href="http://oisss.unc.edu/whats_new/TB.html" target="_blank">Tuberculosis Skin test</a>, if the result is negative, you need not worry, sometimes it might turn out positive if you were administered DPT vaccine when you were a kid. In this case, the doctor will advise you to get a chest X-Ray (should be paid by the Health Insurance) and if that comes out negative, you are fine.</p>

<h2>Health Insurance</h2>

<p>All international students in F-1 or J-1 status are required to purchase the University Health Insurance Plan (currently provided by <a href="http://www.studentinsurance.com/schools/NC/UNC/default.asp" target="_blank">Pearce & Pearce</a>). However, if you get an assistantship in the form of RA or TA, your insurance will be paid by the assistantship and the current vendor for this insurance plan is <a href="http://www.bcbsnc.com/" target="_blank">Blue Cross Blue Shield</a>. Always read the insurance plan in detail so that you will understand how it works. You need to apply for waiver and hence reimbursement of the insurance fees you already paid if you get RA or TA. Ask your department student advisor on the details of applying the online waiver.</p>

<h2>Housing</h2>

<p>It is a good idea to finalize housing plans when you are back home than deciding after arriving. However, if the former does not work out, sort out the housing details as soon as possible. Visit the offices of housing complexes and inspect your rental units and then sign up the lease with them. You will need to transfer the power and water bill on your name, talk to the leasing office folks about this. Also, you may need to contact TimeWarner to get internet connection, while this may take time, you can go to your department and use TarHeel wireless network to browse the internet.</p>

 
<h2>Phone and Data Connection</h2>

<p>AT&amp;T and Verizon have the best connectivity here. The best way to get phone is to get into someone’s family plan who already has an SSN. You will need to ask around if people have a spot open for you to get into their family plan. You will need a data plan in addition to the phone minutes as it helps a lot to get around places using maps (walk or bus routes) via smartphones.</p>

<p>Locate the nearest <a href="http://www.att.com/storelocator/" target="_blank">AT&T Store</a> and inquire about pre-paid plans if you don’t want to get into a family plan. AT&amp;T gives discounts to UNC students, so be sure to take your UNC OneCard when you go the AT&amp;T store.</p>

<h2>Furniture</h2>

<p>It is very expensive to buy new furniture if you take an unfurnished apartment. The best way to get cheap and solid furniture is to visit <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=chapel+hill+thrift+store&fp=1" target="_blank">thrift stores</a> and <a href="http://finance.unc.edu/procurement-services/surplus-property/welcome.html" target=_"blank">UNC Surplus</a>. If you want to buy new furniture, you can check out <a href="http://www.lowes.com/" target="_blank">Lowe’s.</a></p>

<h2>New International Student Orientation</h2>

<p>All new international students are required to attend the orientation. An orientation schedule will be provided in your Welcome Packet. The Information Fair, during which time you can apply for a social security number and purchase health insurance, will be held in the OISSS office. In addition to this, you might have department specific new student orientation and you will be required to attend it.</p>
