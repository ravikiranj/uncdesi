<h1>Food</h1>

<h2>Cooking at Home</h2>
<p>Try to cook at home as much as possible if you are cash strapped. It’s a good idea to eat fresh food everyday than cooking once for a 3-4 days. Most graduate students eat cereals or nutri-bar for breakfast and you may have to eat out during the afternoon unless you bring the overnight cooked food for lunch. Cooking in the evening/night is almost compulsory unless you plan to eat out. It helps if you have roommates who are willing to cook for all than themselves alone so that you can organize the cooking schedule which benefits everyone.</p>

<h2>Eating Out</h2>
<p>New students may initially find it hard to adjust to the change in food, even if it is Indian food. That is because everything is made to suit the American taste (nothing wrong with it). The most hard hit, however are the vegetarians, especially the strict vegetarians who don't eat eggs. The first thing to realize is, only Indians consider eggs to be non-vegetarian. So any time you tell your server you are a vegetarian, be sure to mention you don't eat eggs. Your safest bet would be Indian restaurants or Vegan restaurants.</p>

<p>Another thing to remember is, a lot of American words mean different than what we know in India. A "cheeseburger" mentioned on the menu might be misleading to the Indian eyes, since in India, a cheeseburger is just a burger with a vegetarian patty and lots of cheese. In the US, a cheeseburger by default comes with a beef patty and lots of cheese. Another thing which catches us off-guard, is the water served. By default it comes with ice, even if temperatures outside are below freezing! If you tell your server you want "water without ice," you may get a strange look from them. What you need to say is, "Water, no ice."</p>

<p>However, be warned while using the same for meat. If you say "no meat," they may still use chicken or beef broth since it does not qualify as 'meat'. Make sure to tell your server "vegetarian, no eggs" if you want your food to be completely vegetarian. You can even tell them you want it vegan, if you also want to stay away from milk and any dairy products. When in doubt, describe your preferences in detail to avoid having a miscommunication.</p>

Below is a list of commonly used words which mean different things in US English than what we use back home:
<table border="0" style="margin: 15px auto;">
    <tbody>
    <tr><th>Indian English</th><th>US English</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Okra</td><td>Lady fingers</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Curd</td><td>Plain Yogurt</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bill (restaurant)</td><td>Check/Cheque</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Petrol</td><td>Gas (Gasoline)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Biscuit</td><td>Cookie</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Soft Drink</td><td>Soda / Fountain Drink</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Parcel(food)</td><td>To-go (Can I have this to-go?)</td></tr>

<h2>A few things to remember:</h2>
<ul id="list-to-remember" style="margin-bottom: -10px;">
    <li><p>In the US, most places have free refills for fountain drinks, but these are strictly per person. Do not share refills amidst friends as this might be taken in bad taste by the cafe / restaurant.</p></li>
    <li><p>Your espresso drink (latte, mocha, etc) will come with whipped cream by default. This does not cost anything extra, but make sure to tell your barista "no whipped cream" beforehand if you don't want it.</p></li>
    <li><p>While tipping is an option, you should tip at least 12-15% of the total bill amount. If you are not at all happy with the service and don't think your server deserves a 12% tip, don't tip at all. Remember: Not tipping at all is better than tipping below 10%. But try to tip, since the waiters usually don't get paid by the restaurant and are usually students working for extra income, which is your tip.</p></li>
    <li><p>Buffets will not let you take the remaining food from your plate home, so do not ask for a 'to-go box'.</p></li>
    <li><p>When you ask for "coffee," you will be given a cup full of black brewed coffee. If you like your coffee with milk, specify it. At some places like Dunkin Donuts, they will add milk to your coffee. At other places like Starbucks, you will have to get your own milk at the condiments counter, but if you mention to your server, they will leave room for milk on top.</p></li>
    <li><p>There is no concept of MRP in the US, so each store gets to put their own price on a product. For example, Target may sell bread at $3 while Walmart may sell it at $2.50. Shop smart.</p></li>
    <li><p>Most restaurants close earlier than in India and can even close as early as 9pm on weekdays, except Fridays. Make sure you plan to eat dinner sooner if you plan to go out.</p></li>
    <li><p>Some people have difficulty digesting whole milk (processed) in the US. If you start having an uncomfortable feeling in your tummy, it’s best to switch to 2% Milk or Soy Milk or Almond Milk.</p></li>
    <li><p>If you are going to order food online such as pizza (pizzahut, papa john’s dominos), be sure to check out online coupons or deals. Your best bet to find online coupon code is <a href="www.retailmenot.com" target="_blank">www.retailmenot.com</a></p></li>
