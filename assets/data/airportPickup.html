After you make an entry, a grad student will be assigned to you who will be responsible for your airport pickup. The contact details of him/her will be emailed to you so that you can get in touch.</p>

<h2>What if no one comes to pick me up?</h2>
<p>You will have the contact no. of the person, wait for around 45-60 mins, if he/she doesn't turn up, call them. Mostly, someone or the other will come to pick you up.

Please confirm the fixed rate before you get into the taxi and don't forget to tip 10% once you get down.</p>
