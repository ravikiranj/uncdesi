<div class="answer"><span class="font-bold">A :</span> Refer to <a href="pre-arrival.html">Pre-Arrival information</a></div>

<div class="question">Q : Does working on campus pay your monthly rent, food and for other miscellaneous things? On an average what is your opinion about it? I also want to know if every student get this sufficient pay to cover his monthly, because there can be unlucky ones </div> 
<div class="answer"><span class="font-bold">A :</span> If you already have funding through a TA/RA, the monthly pay will be sufficient for your expenditures and for some recreational activities too. Otherwise, if you get a campus job, it should be possible to make around 400 dollars a month which is sufficient for your monthly expenditure. Nobody can give you a guarantee whether you will get a on campus job, but if you get one with full 20 hours you can make around 400/ 420 $ per month very easily. You have to come prepared to hunt for on campus jobs if you don't have aid. And if you don't get an on-campus job be prepared to support yourself . The chances of getting an on-campus job are pretty slim so don't bank on it.</div>

<div class="question">Q : Can I work off-campus?</div> 
<div class="answer"><span class="font-bold">A :</span> Students on F-1 visas are not allowed to work off-campus. Under extenuating circumstances this restriction may be waived, but only with prior permission from the Immigration and Naturalization Services, and that too only after completing nine months of studies here. The Immigration Department is very strict about permitting F-1 students to work off-campus, even if the situation appears desperate from the point of view of the student. There are some on-campus jobs available for students on a very competitive basis. Spouses on F-2 Visa are not allowed to work under any circumstances.</div>
