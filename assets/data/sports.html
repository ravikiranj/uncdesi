<h1>Sports</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>UNC has a lot to offer if you are interested in playing sports. Right from flag football to baseball to indoor soccer, there is a variety of sports to choose from. Whether you are a beginner or an expert, you can find your ground, quite literally! The intramural games is usually a good place to start. Go out and join a team, your department might have their own team or there are lots of other teams you can join. These teams have players from all expertise levels and this is a good chance to learn a new sport or work on one you already know! Intramural sports start sometime in September and go on throughout the academic year, all the way till April. They have something for every season.</p>

<h2>Outdoor and Indoor Sports</h2>
<p>Outdoor sports like flag football and soccer while it's still warm outside, to basketball and indoor soccer for the winter. Besides, you can join an all-women's or all-men's team or you can choose a co-ed team depending on your comfort level. Besides, there are quite a few soccer and cricket competitions that take place in the Triangle area where people from Chapel Hill, Durham, Cary, Morrisville, Raleigh, Apex etc. make their own teams and participate (these are not free, but the cost is very nominal).</p>

<h2>Gymnasiums</h2>
<p>If you don't want to play a sport but want to stay fit year-round, we have three gymnasiums on campus which are free for UNC students. The closest are Fetzer Gym and Woollen Gym, just off of South road, opposite the Student Union, which are open for students all year round, except, maybe vacation time. These gyms also have a few classes to offer like Yoga, Pilates, Cardio funk, Zumba, Cycling, etc. which can be attended at any time (and of course, free of cost), without any commitment. There are also squash, racquetball and badminton courts, to name a few where you can play / practice on your own (they can lend you equipment if you don't have your own too). More info can be found at http://campusrec.unc.edu/gymnasiums . It would be wise to make use of the gym facilities as you pay the fees for it every semester and it would be a waste of money if you donâ€™t make good use of it.</p>

<p>There are also some climbing walls on campus at the RAMS gymnasium which is a bit of a walk from the main campus, but not more than 10-15 minutes (more exercise / warm-up!) which have some nice climbing walls and indoor soccer courts.</p>

<p>Even if you are in a stressful program in grad school, we highly recommend taking advantage of these on-campus facilities to refresh your mind and stay mentally and physically fit, at least a couple of days a week! You know what they say about all work and no play... :)</p>
