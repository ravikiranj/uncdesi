<h1>Housing</h1>
<h2>On Campus Housing v/s Off Campus Housing</h2>
<p>There are options available for family housing on campus (Grad Students and Post Docs), however, they are expensive compared to off campus housing options.

<h2>Off Campus Housing</h2>
<p>The <a href="assets/docs/2011_Grad_Student_Housing_Report.pdf" target="_blank">Grad School Housing Guide</a> lists all possible apartments close to UNC Campus rated by fellow Grad Students. As far as Indian Students and Post-Docs, most of them live in either <a href="http://www.laurelridgenc.com/LaurelRidge/Index.aspx" target="_blank">Laurel Ridge</a>, <a href="http://theuniversitycommons.com/ucoa/index.asp" target="_blank">University Commons</a> or <a href="http://www.rockcreekcarrboro.com/RockCreek/Index.aspx" target="_blank">Rock creek apartment</a>, all of which are accessible to the university via <a href="http://www.townofchapelhill.org/index.aspx?page=719" target="_blank">J Bus Line</a>. However, there is also a sizeable Indian population living in <a href="http://douthit.biz/foxcroft.htm" target="_blank">Foxcroft</a> ( on D bus line ), <a href="http://www.bellapartmentliving.com/NC/Raleigh/The-Crest/" target="_blank">Crest</a> (CPX Bus Line), <a href="http://www.aspensquare.com/north-carolina/carrboro/berkshire-manor/" target="_blank">Berkshire Manor</a> (CPX Bus Line) and <a href="http://www.apartments.com/North-Carolina/Chapel-Hill/Northampton-Plaza/29888" target="_blank">Northampton Plaza</a> (NS and N bus line, walk-able to campus). The rent amount for decent places can range from $300 to as high as $850 for a single room studio. However, it is advisable to find a roommate before moving in.</p>

<h2>Finding Roommates</h2>
<p>Incoming Indian Grad Students can shoot an email to "unc_desi (at) googlegroups.com" to check if any existing grad student wants to move in with you or any new student like you wants a roommate. You can also lookup people who have got admits into UNC in online forums and contact them if they want to share housing. Most Indian students tend to find other Indian students and live with them. 

<h2>Points to Remember</h2>
<ul class="notelist">
    <li>For first timers, Ask your seniors about housing options with them, as there is always someone moving out or graduating and moving on.</li>
    <li>Over all, chapel hill is quite safe. However, there are a couple of people who have been victims of break ins, so its always better to inquire about safety of the area from seniors.</li> 
    <li>In terms of furnishing, finding a furnished apartments is difficult (there are a couple of apartments that do that) but if you are ready to wait, then you can find or get furniture from people who are moving out within first few months of your moving in here.</li>
    <li>In terms of rent, Chapel Hill and Carrboro are pretty affordable by American Standards, however, there is always a possibility to share a three bedroom apartment among 4 people or a two bedroom apartment among 3 people. that will alleviate the cost of living by some amount.</li>
    <li>The most commonly used bus lines are J, D, N and NS, CPX, and JFX. J, N, and NS routes also run on weekends. So finding an apartment home close to these lines would be good for daily commuting.</li>
