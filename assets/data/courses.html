<h1>Courses</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>It's very difficult without knowing your background and interests to suggest best courses. The best thing to do is to register for more than 3 courses and attend the first few classes and see what fits you better and drop the additional classes later on. You need to register for 9 credit hours during fall/spring semester to maintain your full-time Student status on F-1 Visa. Once you land here, it is also a good idea to talk to seniors and inquire about the courses they took in their first year.</p>
