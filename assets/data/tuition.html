<p>For students who are taking an education loan in India, you can pay the first semester fees by scheduling a wire transfer by following the below procedure. It is to be noted that the education loan laws might change from time to time and this guide is meant to give you an overview of the process only. Please check with your Bank Manager in case you have any doubts.</p>

<h3>Education Loan - Wire Transfer Steps</h3>
<ul class="packlist">
    <li>Once you are sanctioned an education loan, the Bank Manager usually creates a new account called the "loan account" which is essentially a "savings account" but needs his authorization code in order to make any sort of transfer. Sometimes this loan account might be merged with an existing savings account if you have opened in the same bank.</li>

    <li>So, what you are essentially trying to do is to get the bank to release funds to this loan account and shoot it over to US either directly to the university account or your personal account.</li>

    <li>Every transaction that goes out of the country for the bank needs to be logged and usually goes through a Forex (foreign exchange) branch. There might be multiple branches of the same, so ask your Bank Manager which is the nearest one.</li>

    <li>You can issue a request to the manager to release funds to the loan account by filling out Form A-2 and a cover letter (optional in some banks). A PDF copy of the same can be found at http://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/Forms/PDFs/fema-f2.pdf. Make sufficient copies of this form before you leave India. Remember for your 2nd semester, mostly your parents need to perform this procedure, so it helps if you can let them know about these steps.</li>

    <li>Fill the cover letter and Form A-2. Make sure to mention education loan near the account no. in brackets in Form A-2. Choose Option IIIb) for wire transfer and fill in details. If you want to get Travelers Cheque (TC) or Foreign currency, choose IIIc or IIId. Once the manager signs cover letter/Form A-2, he will release the funds to the loan account. Now it's up to you whether you want the funds to stay in loan account or transfer it to your SB account, whichever seems convenient to you (make sure the transfer is cleared, unless the Manager pushes the transaction right away, it usually takes a day for clearance).</li>

    <li><span class="font-bold">Caveat:</span> Some banks need a cover letter kind of form to be filled before Form A-2 to release the funds, please check with your Bank Manager.</span></li>

    <li>Once you are sure the amount is available in the account, take the Form A-2 and Cover Letter (with manager sign) to the Forex branch. Usually they look over the details and sign off.  The transfer will be done before end of day and should take no more than 2 days to complete. Don't forget to take the acknowledgement slip the next day from the Forex branch once the transaction is cleared. You follow the same procedure if you want TC or Cash, except instead of a wire transfer, they will usually call an agency which will issue the TC/Cash on spot and an acknowledgment is issued right away.</li>

    <li><span class="font-bold">Caveat:</span> If you forget to mention the account as an education loan account, they will consider the wire transfer as industrial and deduct 2+% of the total transfer amount than a meager Rs.500. Usually they do ask these questions but I'm just giving you a heads up.</li>

    <li>Wire transfer account details should be available at <a href="http://finance.unc.edu/student-accounts-and-university-receivables/student-account-services/payment-options-and-access.html#wiretransfers" target="_blank">Finance - Student Account Services</a>. Please verify with cashier@unc.edu before you do a wire transfer to check if the details are correct.</li>

    <li>After you complete the wire transfer, you need to send a mail to cashier@unc.edu with the wire transfer details.</li>

    <li>Sit tight and wait for 2 days to hear a reply from the UNC Cashier saying that they received the transfer and posted the changes on your account.</li>

    <li>If you are transferring the money to your BofA account (later semester), the procedure is exactly the same, except wire transfer details change.  When you open a BofA account, ask for Swift No. of the branch, the routing and account no. will be available online.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's highly encouraged to involve one of your parent in this entire process, so that they have an idea of what to do when you are here and need a fund transfer via wire. Also leave a copy of a filled Form-A2 with them (might help).</p>
