<h1>Shopping</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The main thing to remember while you are here, is to stop converting all prices into Rupees so everything does not seem expensive and you can live a normal life. There is nothing to be embarrassed about, since all of us have the conversion rate in mind when we first come here, but the quicker you get it out of your head, the better. Also, some things might seem a little too high, but these are necessities and if you shop around a bit, you can find great deals.</p>

<h2>Clothes</h2>
<p>You need winter coats for the sub-zero temperatures in January/February, but if you go coat shopping right now while it is still warm, you are likely to get some discounted rates. One good place to look at is Burlington Coat Factory. It is also a good idea to look at Thrift Stores (there are a couple in Carrboro and there's Goodwill and ReStore in Durham) where sometimes you can get used goods in great condition at a very low price, right from clothes, pots and pans, lamps and books, to couches and chairs. In NC we don't really need thermal wear so do not waste money on these.</p>

<h2>Caveat</h2>
<p>Here is something that can help you decide what is expensive and what is a good price to pay for. In case of food items, whatever is the USD amount, multiple it by 10 or 20. If you would have paid that many rupees in India, it is a good price. For example, if you get a sandwich for $7, that multiplied by 10 will be 70, which sounds like a fair deal since food portions are larger in the US. Pizzas are a fair deal if you get $15 for a medium pizza that would feed 2 people. Normally, $15, give or take, is a good price to pay for a meal for one person. With clothes, you usually multiply by 15 or 20 to get a good idea. Normally it is okay to pay $11-$16 for a shirt, but then again, it depends on the brand. One other difference in shopping in the US is, whatever the prices of things in your shopping cart are, you will be charged an additional tax, so expect your final bill to be about 10-20% more than what the prices of the items are.</p>

<h2>General Shopping</h2>
<p>Since we don't have Target / Walmart at walking distance in Chapel Hill and since the CHT buses don't serve that area, a lot of new students either take the TTA buses or go grocery shopping with someone who has a car. There is a very nice mall called Southpoint in Durham, which is about 15 minutes by car. If you need shoes, clothes or other nice goods, again, you can ask one of the car owners for a ride or just tag along when they go.</p>

<h2>Emergency Shopping</h2>
<p>For emergency shopping, you can buy items from Walgreens at Franklin Street and beware that the items are a little pricey. Another cheapers alternative is to take J bus towards Jones Ferry and go to Carborro (get down at Jade Palace restaurant) and walk to Harris Teeter which is open 24x7. You can also come back on the J bus route itself towards Rock Haven. Take reusable cloth bags if you plan to bring a lot of items and itâ€™s best if two people go together so that you can bring more items.</p>

<h2>Movies</h2>
<p>We have quite a few movie theaters in and around Chapel Hill. Most of the shows will have a student discount so remember to carry your UNC OneCard with you. Some theaters will only accept cash so make sure you have about $10-20 in cash. Be sure to keep some amount in your budget for entertainment and to spoil yourself. There is nothing wrong in watching a movie or two or going out for dinner or ice cream once or twice a week! Again, when in doubt, ring up one of the old students for advice, we are here to help!</p>
